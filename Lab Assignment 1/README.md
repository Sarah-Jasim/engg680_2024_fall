This assignment is about creating a student gradebook management system using python libraries and to understand and implement Git for collaboration.
The first part of the assignment is about printing, formatting, and indexing data structures like strings and tuples. In part two, we imported the pandas library and loaded our files. Then we merged English and math grades, calculated GPA, and dropped the duplicated columns (first name and last name). Using the .describe() function we calculated the mean, standard deviation minimum, maximum values, and others. After importing Numpy, we sorted the data based on GPA descendingly. Function .iloc is used for finding the top student since the data frame was already sorted by GPA in a Descending manner. So, the first index indicates the top student. Next, we identified the students have math grades over 90 and found four students have math grades over 90.
In part 3, we imported our homeroom csv file for students and merged it with the previous previous data frame containing student grades. Then we determined the the homeroom with the highest GPA by using the .iloc function, that came up with the highest GPA was 311 with a GPA of 88.79. Additionally, we also did the maximum GPA per homeroom
In part four,  we plotted  the math grades in a histogram with legend as well as titles and saved the image as a .png file  after that we created a scatter diagram of English and math grades with proper labels and titles. Finally, we analyzed the relationships between the grades.
