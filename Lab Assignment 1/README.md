This assignment is about creating a student gradebook management system divided into four parts. The first part is about the greetings and by using f string we printed our group number and intake year.
 In part two, first, we imported the pandas library and loaded our files.  Then we merged English and math grades, calculated GPA, and dropped the duplicated columns (firstname and last name). Using the .describe() function we calculated the mean, standard deviation minimum, maximum values, and others.
After importing Numpy, we sorted the data based on GPA descendingly. Function .iloc is used for finding the top student since the dataframe was already sorted by GPA in Descending manner. So, the first index indicates the top student. Next we identified the students have mathgrades over 90 and found four students have mathgrades over 90.
in part 3, we imported our homeroom csv file for students and merged it with the previous previous dataframe containing student grades. Then we determined the the homeroom with the highest GPA by using .iloc function, that came up with the highest GPA was 311 with a GPA of 88.79. Additionally, we also did the maximum GPA per homeroom
In part four,  we plotted  the math grades in a histogram with legend as well as titles and saved the image as .png file  after that we created a scatter diagram of english and math grades with proper labels and titles. finally, we showed the relationships between the grades.
